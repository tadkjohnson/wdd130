            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="this is a picture of Tad Johnson" width="200">
            <br><p>My name is Tad Johnson. I currently live in Trenton, Tennessee. My family moved here last year from Salt Lake
            City, for a mountain of reasons. I have three children, ages 21, 13, and 8 years old. I have always wanted
            to learn programing and web design but never had the opportunity and am incredibly intimidated by it. I have worked
            around computers (building, fixing, repairing) since 1997, but was busy playing cop until 2015. In 2016, I obtained
            employment at a local hospital working in desktop support, have since obtained a few certificates, but now have the 
            ability to starting learning and following my dream. </p>
            <br><p>I worked in "IT" in high school, but while chasing excitement I began to work in Law Enforcement.  After 18 years 
                of a few highs and many lows, which includes high stress, frusteration of watching many, many people 
                fail, die, return to drugs, and incarceration, as well as losing touch with my family, and having mulitple overdoes and deaths with those I worked with.
                  I returned to work with computers, begining to work as a intern with Intermountain Health.  During my eight years, I was lead tech with mulitiple projects: including a hospital closure, three clinic clousures, a hospital expanistion,
                  and mulitple clinic remodels. My wife and I decided to move to Tennessee.  </p>        <br>
            <p>When in Utah, we attend church in an active ward of 300+ members, now we attend church at a branch of almost
            60 active members. Everyone has a calling, everyone gets to talk, teach, pray, and step outside their
            comfortable bubble. I figure if I can do that, I can learn this. </p>

            <h2> Tennessee </h2>
            <img src="images/tennessee.jpg" alt="this is a picture of Tennessee" width="200">
            <p> A state offering a diverse range of attractions, from the music scene in Nashville, to the Great Smoky
            Mountains. Visit large citys to open farmland, and everything inbetween.
            You can visit Graceland, Dollywood, Grand Ole Opry, and the secret city of Oak Ridge, as it took part in the
            Manhattan Project.   </p>
            <br> <p>If you look at the tourist sites, you get a sense that Tennessee, is all about music, history, celebrites: "Elvis, Dolly Parton, President Jackson and Megan Fox" come to mind.  In moving here and living here I do not see that.  I see living in the bible belt, 100's of different churchs, having dry counties, unique liquor laws, and in the rural areas a more family oriented, respectful way of life.  There is those who want to change everything to what they feel is the "future" but most people just want to live on thier farm, watch their children and crops grow.  </p>
