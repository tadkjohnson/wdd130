        <p>My name is Tad Johnson. I currently live in Trenton, Tennessee. My family moved here last year from Salt Lake
            City, for a mountain of reasons. I have three children, ages 21, 13, and 8 years old. I have always wanted
            to learn
            programing and web design but never had the opportunity and am incredibly intimidated by it. I have worked
            around computers
            (building, fixing, repairing) since 1997, but was busy playing cop until 2015. In 2016, I obtained
            employment at a local hospital
            working in desktop support, have since obtained a few certificates, but now have the ability to starting
            learning and following my
            dream. </p>

        <p>When in Utah, we attend church in an active ward of 300+ members, now we attend church at a branch of almost
            60 active members. Everyone has a calling, everyone gets to talk, teach, pray, and step outside their
            comfortable
            bubble. I figure if I can do that, I can learn this. </p>

        <h2> Tennessee </h2>
        <img src="images/tennessee.jpg" alt="this is a picture of Tennessee" width="200">
        <p> A state offering a diverse range of attractions, from the music scene in Nashville, to the Great Smoky
            Mountains. Visit large citys to open farmland, and everything inbetween.
            You can visit Graceland, Dollywood, Grand Ole Opry, and the secret city of Oak Ridge, as it took part in the
            Manhattan Project.
